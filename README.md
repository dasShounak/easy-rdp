# easy-rdp

A simple script to connect to a RDP session using `xfreerdp` because of course I forget the
parameters everytime :)

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Make the script executable and run it.
3. Add the username, password and the address of the remote machine to connect through RDP.
4. You can add it to your PATH to make your life easier.

## Note

I have added `/dynamic-resolution` and `/scale:140` by default. Change it according to your needs.
